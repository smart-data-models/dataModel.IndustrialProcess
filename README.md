# dataModel.IndustrialProcess
These are generic data models for process industry. The models have been developed from the needs of steelmaking, but similar data structures are expected appropriate in other application areas as well. The processes can be batch processes or continuous.

### List of data models

The following entity types are available:
- [ProcessChemicalAnalysis](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.IndustrialProcess/blob/master/ProcessChemicalAnalysis/README.md). Schema for chemical analyses from industrial processes

- [ProcessEvent](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.IndustrialProcess/blob/master/ProcessEvent/README.md). Schema for generic events in industrial processes

These data models were developed in the project ALCHIMIA - Data and decentralized Artificial intelligence for a competitive and green European metallurgy industry. This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 101070046. See https://alchimia-project.eu/
